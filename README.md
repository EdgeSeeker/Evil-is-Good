# Evil is Good!
Based on Dungeon Keeper, and developed in Unity3D, you take a form of a 'Keeper' for a dungeon. You fight enemies, you battle Hereos, and you make the land evil again.

Please, feel free to contribute if you want. It would be much appreciated.
You can download this project and open it using Unity3D 2017.3.0f
