# It is Good to be Evil
Evil is Good is a game based on the original *Dungeon Keeper* where you manage and build your own dungeon to kill your enemies and conquer the land. This is a clone of that game, that works on modern hardware running Windows, Mac, and Linux. Though you probably want to get to the good stuff. This game is open-source, meaning you can contribute to it, fork from it, and even download the source. It is all developed in Unity3D and will need to be built using Unity3D.
